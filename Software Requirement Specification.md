<p>The following chapter provides an overview of this project with vision and Overall Use Case Diagram. The third chapter (Requirements Specification) delivers more details about the specific requirements in terms of functionality, usability and design parameters. Finally there is a chapter with supporting information.</p>
<h2 id="overall-description">2. Overall Description</h2>
<h3 id="vision">2.1 Vision</h3>
<p>Our vision is to make an Android-App which you can use to share workout-plans and look at plans from other people. Through an account you will be able to track things like, weight, heart rate and body measurements. You will be able to track your progress of what exercises you have done and how you improved. The workout plans will be categorized, and you can filter<br>
which muscles you want to train. So you won’t lose your motivation you can look for different plans and progresses, of other users to motivate you.</p>

</table><h2 id="specific-requirements">3. Specific Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="functionality">3.1 Functionality</h3>
<p>This section shows the different functions we plan to implement in our App<br>
<em>3.1.1 Posting Workouts</em><br>
This allows you to post your own workout plan<br>
<em>3.1.2 Posting Results</em><br>
This allows you to share your result for a specific workout<br>
<em>3.1.3 Creating an Account</em><br>
User can create their own account and give personal information that can be used for tracking and suggestions.<br>
<em>3.1.4 Logging in</em><br>
This app provides the possibility to log into the account and track progress in the app<br>
<em>3.1.5. Logging out</em><br>
This allows to terminate the app<br>
<em>3.1.6. Getting an overview</em><br>
Provides a basic overview over recent workouts and shows progress. Further you can select a workout from this view<br>
<em>3.1.7. Finding Workouts</em><br>
See workouts from different people and get inspired</p>
<h3 id="usability">3.2 Usability</h3>
<p>The idea is to create a basic, intuitive and simple User Interface that allows users to use the app without much explanation.<br>
<em>3.2.1 Usability Requirement One</em> TBD</p>
<h3 id="reliability">3.3 Reliability</h3>
<p>TBD</p>
<h3 id="performance">3.4 Performance</h3>
<p><em>3.4.1 Capacity</em><br>
The system should be able to manage thousands of requests. Also it should be possible to register as many users as necessary.<br>
<em>3.4.2 Storage</em><br>
Smartphones don’t provide much storage. Therefore, we are aiming to keep the needed storage as small as possible.<br>
<em>3.4.3 App perfomance / Response time</em><br>
To provide the best App perfomance we aim to keep the response time as low as possible. This will make the user experience much better.</p>
<h3 id="supportability">3.5 Supportability</h3>
<p><em>3.5.1 Coding Standards</em><br>
We are going to write the code by using the most common clean code standards. For example, we will name our variables and methods by their functionalities. This will keep the code easy to read by everyone and make further development much easier.<br>
<em>3.5.2 Testing Strategy</em><br>
The application will have a high test coverage and all important functionalities and edge cases should be tested. Further mistakes in the implementation will be discovered instantly and it will be easy to locate the error.</p>
<h3 id="design-constraints">3.6 Design Constraints</h3>
<p>TBD</p>
<h3 id="online-user-documentation-and-help-system-requirements">3.7 Online User Documentation and Help System Requirements</h3>
